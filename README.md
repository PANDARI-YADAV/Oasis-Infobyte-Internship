# Oasis-Infobyte-Internship Task 2(Number Guessing Game)
 I developed a console-based 'Guess the Number' game using Core Java. This interactive project showcases my skills in creating engaging and user-friendly applications.

✨ Here’s how it works:

The game generates a random number between 1 and 100.
Players have a limited number of attempts to guess the number correctly.
Feedback like "Too high" or "Too low" guides the user, making it a fun and dynamic experience.
Scores are calculated based on the remaining attempts, and users can choose to play multiple rounds.
This project helped me enhance my understanding of control flow, loops, error handling, and user interaction in Java. It's a perfect example of how programming can make problem-solving fun and creative.
